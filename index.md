**Synopsis:** This series of lessons cover some of the research computing services offered by the Sydney Informatics Hub at the University of Sydney. You can learn about High Performance Computing (HPC) including our in-house HPC ‘Artemis’, plus our in-house data storage capabilities, and how to make use of these and other research computing facilities. 

**Target audience:** Researchers and students looking to use the University of Sydney High performance Computer. For the actual workshops participants must have a valid University of Sydney unikey. Otherwise you are free to adapt this content for your own use. Check the calander for upcoming live sessions.

> ## Prerequisites
> Competency on the Unix/Linux command line:
>
> * If you are interested in learning research computing and HPC but have no Unix/Linux command-line skills, you should first take an [Introduction to Unix/Linux](https://intersect.org.au/training/course/unix) course to understand some of the fundamental concepts.
>
> For the workshops participants will generally require their own laptop.

# Workshops

| Lesson    | Overview |
| ------- | ---------- |
| [Introduction to Artemis HPC]({{ site.sih_pages }}/training.artemis.introhpc/) | Introduces USyd's High Performance Computer (HPC), ‘Artemis’. We cover connecting and navigating Artemis, available software, and how to submit and monitor jobs using the PBS Pro scheduler.|
| [Introduction to the Research Data Store and Data Transfer]({{ site.sih_pages }}/training.artemis.rds) |  Learn how to transfer data between your local computer, external sources, the University's Research Data Store (RDS) and Artemis HPC. |
|[Intermediate Artemis HPC (Automation)]({{ site.sih_pages }}/training.artemis.interhpc) | Learn how to automate multiple-run analyses with job arrays and do simple bash scripting on Artemis. The live training consists of two hours of instruction and practical exercises. |
|[Matlab on Artemis: The MDCS](https://informatics.sydney.edu.au/training/coursedocs/MDCS_MatlabTraining.pdf) | Artemis HPC hosts a Matlab Distributed Computing Server (MDCS) - this allows users to submit MATLAB jobs directly to Artemis from within their local Matlab instance on their machines. Come and learn how to use this service. |
|[Introduction to GPU computing with HPC]({{ site.sih_pages }}/training.artemis.gpu) | Introduces GPU computing, and running GPU jobs on Artemis and other HPC systmes. |
|[Parallel Python]({{ site.sih_pages }}/training.artemis.python) | Learn some simple and effective tools and logic to make your Python code faster, then learn how to use brute force to scale it on a HPC cluster. |
